# TP/TN/OSC/EB Functions
This folder contains functions related to TP, TN, and OSC matrices, the EB factorizatiopn of I-TN (i.e. invertible-TN) matrices and the associated planar diagrams. Main functions are stored in TP_TN_OSC_funcs.py. Note that the functions in MC.py are included in TP_TN_OSC_funcs.py.

## Notebooks
See eb_factorization_example.ipynb for several exmples.

analyze_osc.ipynb tries to deduce the exponent of an oscillatory matrices.
