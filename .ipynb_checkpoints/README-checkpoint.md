# TP/TN/OSC/EB Functions
This folder contains Python functions and scripts related to TP, TN, and OSC matrices, the EB factorization of I-TN (i.e. invertible-TN) matrices, and the associated planar diagrams. Main functions are stored in TP_TN_OSC_funcs.py. Note that the functions in MC.py are included in TP_TN_OSC_funcs.py.

## Notebooks
- See eb_factorization_example.ipynb for several exmples.

- See mat_call_py_example.m for a Matlab example using these Python functions.

- analyze_osc.ipynb tries to deduce the exponent of an oscillatory matrices.
